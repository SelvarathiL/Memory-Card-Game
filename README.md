Motivational Blog Dashboard

This is built using React and demonstrates component-based development. The App component manages a list of motivational posts and passes data as props to the Post component. Each post card uses React state to toggle between short and full descriptions with a "Read More / Read Less" button. A reusable Navbar component is added for smooth navigation, and React-Bootstrap is used to style the layout with responsive grids and cards.
